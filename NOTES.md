🧾 Notes — Python Sales Data Analysis Project
📘 Dataset Reference

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle:
/kaggle/input/vijayarani-t-final-test1/sales_dataset.xlsx - Sheet1.csv

It contains detailed sales transactions, including:

Order IDs, product categories, and quantities sold

Revenue, order status (valid/cancelled), and fulfillment details

Customer type (B2B/B2C), region, and date of purchase

🧩 Objective

To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python to:

Understand sales performance and category trends

Calculate Average Order Value (AOV) and Cancellation Rate

Detect high-performing products and seasonal sales patterns

Prepare data insights for visualization and storytelling

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python (Data Cleaning & Analysis)

Pandas, NumPy (Data manipulation)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)

Jupyter Notebook (Exploration & Documentation)

📊 Key Steps

Imported and validated the dataset from the Kaggle source.

Cleaned and formatted data (handled nulls, normalized column names, removed outliers).

Created new calculated fields (e.g., Valid Amount, AOV, Cancellation Rate).

Visualized sales trends, category performance, and order status using charts.

🔍 Key Insights

Set and Kurta were the top revenue-generating categories.

Overall Average Order Value (AOV) ≈ ₹545.

Cancellation Rate ~14%, primarily due to fulfillment or seasonal demand shifts.

Sales peaked during April–May, reflecting strong seasonal demand.

🚀 Outcome

This Python-based analysis provided a data foundation for creating an interactive business insights visualization using matplotlib, linking raw data exploration with business storytelling.
